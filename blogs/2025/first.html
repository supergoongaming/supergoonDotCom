<h1>Video Game Development</h1>
<p>I started video game development way back in the days of RPG maker.  I have some vivid memories of actually making something cool in there.  Spending a lot of time making some big maps, and cool event based actions.  I was doing this as a high schooler. That was mostly not coding though.  I did do some HTML/css when working with the oldschool buddy4u websites, which was a way to make your own personal site and most kids linked it into their AIM (AOL Instant Messenger), to show some skills.  Sadly, both the old RPG maker and my buddy4u are nowhere to be found, as much as I'd like to actually look at it.</p> 
<p>After high school I had a long time before I would start coding again.. so "graduation" in 2007, I probably wouldn't touch it again until 2018.  So, 11 years later, I really started to dive into IT as a career, and then late that year I got a role as a network administrator.  That was mostly doing some traditional IT work, but one of my coworkers, Gabe, was really into learning C# and building a work platform for it.  I decided that I wanted to start getting into Unity during that time; as I dived into RPG maker and made a silly little RPG maker game that was really cool, but couldn't make any actual edits to it cause it was so standard.</p>
<p>From there, I fell in love with C# and unity.. making Triple Triad after following a couple of simple tutorials on the internet.  You can play that on my projects page, but from there I started to get more and more into low level programming.</p>
